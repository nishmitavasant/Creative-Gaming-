Creative Gaming: Uplift Modeling for "Space Pirates" Campaign
Overview
This project aims to enhance the targeting strategies for the Zalon campaign in "Space Pirates," a game developed by Creative Gaming. Through the application of uplift modeling, we identified customer segments most likely to respond positively to the campaign. This strategic approach allowed for more effective use of marketing resources, optimizing the adoption rate of the campaign.

Objective
The primary objective was to analyze data from 60,000 customers, divided equally into a control group and a treatment group, to identify the top 30,000 customers who would most benefit from targeted advertising. This was done to maximize campaign adoption and increase the efficiency of the marketing spend.

Results
The project successfully targeted the optimal customer segment, resulting in a significant enhancement in the adoption rate of the Zalon campaign. By implementing uplift modeling techniques, we achieved a measurable increase in customer response rates and substantial ROI through targeted advertising efforts. Key performance metrics include Uplift (%) and Incremental Uplift (%).
